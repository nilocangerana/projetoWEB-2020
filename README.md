1. Requirements: 
The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any
new requirement needed by your particular store implementation.


2. Project Description: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the
requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

3. Comments About the Code: Any comment you may want to add to help understand
your code. This is good programming practice.

4. Test Plan: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test
tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, jUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used.

5. Test Results: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is
used, its output can be used.

6. Build Procedures: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to
install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally
how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow
these commands (nothing more).

7. Problems: List any major problems you had.

8. Comments: Any comments you wish to add.
